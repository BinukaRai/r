### using RStudio Cloud

If you're using RStudio Cloud, go to https://rstudio.cloud and log in (or create an account if needed).  Click on Your Workspace in the left Menu.  Then make sure you are on the Projects tab, and click down arrow in the blue button for New Project.  Choose the option of New Project from a Git Repo.  The repo address is https://github.com/nuitrcs/r_intro_june2018.

This will copy all of the files from this repository into your new project.  This will take a few moments to copy files from this repository.  You'll then need to install packages.  Open `packagelist.r` and run the code.  The tidyverse package will take a while to install.  

You can use this space like you would your RStudio on own computer, except you can only access the files that are part of the project and save files within the project.

## Types of Files

The main materials are slides.  Keynote and Powerpoint versions are available:

* Google Slide will be shared once complete. 

Exercises we do during the workshop are either in the slides or in .R files in the [exercises directory](/exercises).

Reference materials and independent practice exercises are written in RMarkdown (*.Rmd).  You can open these files directly in RStudio and run the code chunks.  The RMarkdown files have also been converted to html files for easy viewing.  Exercise files have one RMarkdown file (with answers) and two html files (one with and one without answers).  Links to the html files are in the [coreexercises directory](/coreexercises).

## Opening/Downloading Files

RMarkdown files can be previewed in GitHub, but they won't include the output of the code cells.  HTML files generated from the RMarkdown generally can't be previewed directly in the GitHub repository view, but they can be viewed online through GitHub Pages; links are provided for that where relevant.  HTML files are self-contained; this means they are on the large side, but they can be downloaded and viewed locally as a single file.

REMEMBER: if downloading individual files from GitHub, you want to download the RAW version of a file.  Otherwise, it's often better to download everything together by using the green clone/download button for the entire repository.

## Other Resources

An extensive list of good R resources can be found in the [main R workshop repository](https://github.com/nuitrcs/rworkshops).
